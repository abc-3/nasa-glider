# NASA Orbiter + 747 Glider Design

This repository provides detailed instructions for building a balsa wood glider modeled after a NASA Orbiter, along with a companion glider in the shape of a 747 Airjet. The 747 is designed to carry the Orbiter and release it mid-flight using attachment mechanisms engineered with neodymium magnets. The vision for this project is to create a hands-on, team-based creative workshop where participants collaboratively build and test these gliders, experiencing the excitement of aerospace-inspired design.
